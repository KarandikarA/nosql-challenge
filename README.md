# nosql-challenge

This challenge was focusing on food saftey ratings from the UK Food Standards Agency to help magzine writers decide where they should write in their next articles. 
## Updated code 
I have updated the code to fix the errors that meant that any querry returned no result 
## Part 1: Database and Jupyter Notebook Set Up
    - The database was imported from the Json file in resources 
    - it was then stored in the UK food database and the establishments collection
    - Pymongo library was used to establish a connection with the MongoDB server 
    - Coding was done to research the data in the server 
## Part 2: Update the Database
    - In this part, you were meant to add a new restaurant called Penang Flavours to the dataabase 
    - the coding retrived BusinessTypeID and found the one associated with Restaurant
    - it then updated BusinessTypeID to include the new restaurant 
    - changed the establishments in Dover and deleted it. 

For this project, I mainly used the module 12 instructions to help me out.
